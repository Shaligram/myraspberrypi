Optimize forward lookup by calculating the time lapse 
e.g - it should move for 1 sec but if obstacle at t time. then after rerouting it should move to t1=(1-t) sec

Approach.
-# Calculated forward movement based on the visible distance and actual path to traverse from the route MAP
-# Timed feedback to move forward. e.g - it should move for 1 sec but if obstacle at t time. then after rerouting it should move to t1=(1-t) sec
-# Sharp Turns else path is lost on every movement.
-# Support Rerouting only for 3 times 
-# While on Turns need to check the turning radius, else move forward a bit. So feedback driven forward + Normal controlled forward.

-# Add AI in rememebering the Obstacle location by marking on Map -- FUTURE
